This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Python exercises, practice snippets, and small-scale projects developed and tested in Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks reflect my learning and exploration of core Python programming concepts through the Certificate of Data Analytics and Visualisation (CDAV) course at Strathmore University, with an emphasis on logic building, user interaction, file handling, error control, and real-world mini applications.

Login systems with retry logic

Input loops and menu-based command line tools

📚 Audience
These notebooks are great for:

Python beginners who want to see how real-world logic can be implemented with basic tools.

Students practicing for exams or project development.

Anyone looking to explore how simple programs can handle real-life scenarios like user logins or transaction systems.

💡 Goals
Practice structured programming with real-time feedback.

Build confidence in user input handling and logical flow.

Learn how to debug and validate data cleanly without breaking the program.
